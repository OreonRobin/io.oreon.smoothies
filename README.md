# Oreon Smoothies

Simple CRUD application using Vue.js for managing smoothies. 

On the back end a firestore database is hosted on Firebase while [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) is used as the Material Design CSS framework 

## Local setup

- Clone project
- Install dependencies `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Serve with hot reload at `localhost:8080` with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
- Build for production with `npm run build` or `yarn build`

## Live project

A live version of the project can be interacted with at https://udemy-oreon-smoothies.firebaseapp.com/

As this is just a pet project of mine, no authentication is included and you're free to add/delete/edit smoothies  
However, please do be mindful when adding smoothies that you're not creating a massive amount of them
